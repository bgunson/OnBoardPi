OnBoardPi is a web based application which can be installed in any OBD2 compliant (1996 or newer) vehicle using a Raspberry Pi or similar single board computer. Parameters such as RPMs, speeds, or temperatures can be monitored on dashboards, tables, and charts in real time. OnBoardPi also integrates with [BlueWave Studio's OpenAuto Pro](https://bluewavestudio.io/shop/openauto-pro-car-head-unit-solution/) by injecting values via its API allowing users to use both softwares at once. 


## Quick Install

OpenAuto Pro 16 users please see [this issue](https://github.com/bgunson/onboardpi/issues/37) before installing.

**Requires**
- Docker - see [optional post-install steps](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/) to manage Docker as a non-root user if desired otherwise use `sudo` for Docker commands.
```
curl -sSL https://get.docker.com | sh
```

[Link to Docker images](https://hub.docker.com/search?q=bgunson%2Fonboardpi)

Then, in a directory of your choice:
```
mkdir onboardpi && cd onboardpi
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bgunson/onboardpi/main/docker-compose.yml > docker-compose.yml
docker compose up -d
```
> Docker Compose should be included with the Docker CLI, however if you have an older version of Docker you can install it specifically using `python3 -m pip install docker-compose` and run OnBoardPi using `docker-compose` with a hyphen.

Open a browser and navigate to [http://raspberrypi.local](http://raspberrypi.local)

TIP: If your Pi's hostname is different from the default then use that in place of 'raspberrypi'. For example, set the hostname to 'onboardpi' and navigate to [http://onboardpi.local](http://raspberrypi.local)

*mDNS (hostname IP resolution) does not work on all operating systems such as Android so you will need to navigate using the Pi's IP address.*

Please consult the [wiki](https://github.com/bgunson/onboardpi/wiki/Installation) or create an issue if needed.

## Features

- Access from any device that runs a modern and capable web broswer, no need to download any unknown OBDII apps
- Dark and light modes
- Lightweight and customizable
- Keep all your vehicle data close and accessible 

*Screenshots were taken from a testing environment and do not reflect actual data.*

Thanks to [MockuPhone](https://mockuphone.com/) for the device mock-ups.

### Dashboard

### Maintenance
- Store your vehicle maintenance in a convenient table (stored in a database on the Raspberry Pi)

## Roadmap
- Datalogging using [TimescaleDB](https://www.timescale.com/)
    - Log sys info
    - Log OBD commands
    - Client-side visualization, leaning toward Highcharts
- Clear diagnostic codes - I currently do not have any CEL to test this on ;)
- Multiple dashboards
- Imperial unit conversion support
- Cloud backups somewhere down the line
