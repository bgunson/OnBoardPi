    Injector template class. To provide a basis and structure for OnBoardPi's ability to export

    Going forward this pattern can be used for numerous types of data exportation. Once an injector knows which
    OBD commands it needs, the watch/unwatch mechanism (alongside socketio clients) will already be implemented. 
    - Local datalogging of OBD values to timescaledb can be made from an injector
    - Use an injector as an MQTT client
    - Can even add support for more protocols down the road
